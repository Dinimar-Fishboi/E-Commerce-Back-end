## Installation

User must run npm install or yarn to ensure all packages are successfully added to the application. In addition, they will need to modify the `.env.EXAMPLE` file to `.env` while also updating the password and username to their own.

## Usage

User will need to create the database by entering the MySQL monitor in the `db` directory and rung `source schema.sql`, then seed the data by running `node seeds/index.js`.

## Tests

Once the user has created their database and seeded it, if they return to the MySQL monitor and run `SELECT * FROM Categories`, they will be able to view their data and confirm the file has been successfully prepped before launching the code via `node server.js`.

## Issues

For unknown reasons, a 400 error code arises when running a PUT function. However - the data is successfully updated. We are working on fixing this issue.
